excerpt: 'I researched and applied how to control servo motor in Stm32. I performed the servo driving process with the PWM signal. I calculated the pwm signal required for our system. I wrote the communication protocol between the server application and stm32. I was also part of the PID algorithm development team and performed the integration of image processing and PID operations. Also worked well on the website.'
