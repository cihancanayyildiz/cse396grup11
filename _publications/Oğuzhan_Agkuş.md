excerpt: 'I have worked in a few modules took part in integrating whole system. Firstly, I built the mechanical part of the project. Then I have researched how to generate PWM signals on STM32 board to control servo motors and contributed on embedded code. I desigend and coded a simple communication and verification protocol between STM32 board and server machine over the serial port. I designed a communication protocol between the server and clients. I designed user interfaces of server and desktop client applications. I took part in integrating the image processing and PID calculation modules to server. I strived to deploy our app for multiple platforms (Linux and Windows).'
